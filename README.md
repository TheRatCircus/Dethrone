# Dethrone

Dethrone was what I called my first try at writing a game. As the repository description suggests, it was meant to be a Metroidvania-type game implemented in Unity, with the selling point being richly customizable attacks and abilities. I eventually fell out of love with this idea - the game would likely have ended up being not too different from Hollow Knight - and moved on to Pantheon (https://github.com/TheRatCircus/Pantheon-Unity).

Disclaimer: I was an amateur when I wrote all of this code so it's rather naive.
